- Properly determine order to reload dependencies:

    1. Construct a complete dependency graph. Essentially a dictionary
       of modules to their ordered imports.

    2. Check the mtime on every one of those files.

    3. Reduce the dependency graph to only those modules that have been
       changed, or depend on something that has. Have a reverse-mapping
       (from modules to those which depend on them) so you can establish
       a single set of everything that was modified or is affected.

    4. Linearize the remaining graph with something like C3. See my
       implementation: https://github.com/mikeboers/C3Linearize . We
       will not be able to fully linearize it due to import cycles, so
       we need to have some deterministic something for that occourance.
       
    5. Walk through that list in reverse order reloading everything.
